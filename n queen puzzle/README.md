# N-Queens Problem Solvers

This repository contains two desktop applications for solving the N-Queens problem using different algorithms:

1. **Genetic Algorithm Solver**: Uses genetic algorithms to find a solution to the N-Queens problem.
2. **Simulated Annealing Solver**: Uses simulated annealing to find a solution to the N-Queens problem.

Both applications are created using Python's Tkinter library and provide interactive graphical interfaces for solving and visualizing the N-Queens problem.

## Features

- **Genetic Algorithm Solver**:
  - Generates an initial population of board configurations.
  - Uses selection, crossover, and mutation to evolve solutions.
  - Displays the initial board and the optimal solution found.

- **Simulated Annealing Solver**:
  - Utilizes the simulated annealing technique to solve the N-Queens problem.
  - Provides an interactive graphical interface to input board size and initial configuration.
  - Displays the initial board and the optimized solution.
